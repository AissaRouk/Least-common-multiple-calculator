# Least common multiple calculator

This is a project I made with my little brothers to explain them how app creation works, we decided to do this kind of calculator because they are studying this topic in class. It was fun and we had lots of quality time.

## Description

It's a simple app that calculates the least common multiple calculator with two numeric inputs and a button.
